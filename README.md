The data pertaining to meals is retrieved and subjected to a process of cleaning and refinement. The feature extraction is performed for velocity, acceleration, IQR, entropy, and the Fast Fourier transform. Following the process of feature extraction, the insulin data was partitioned into bins, resulting in a total of six bins. The K-means clustering technique is executed by specifying the number of clusters as the desired number of bins that I discovered. It is observed that there is a significant drop in inertia, or sum of squared errors (SSE), as the number of clusters grows. The K-means entropy and purity were calculated by generating a confusion matrix or pivot table, with the predicted value as the rows and the ground truth labels as the columns.
In a similar manner, the DB-Scan algorithm was employed on the identical meal feature matrix, with user-specified parame- ters set to an epsilon value of 0.5 and a minimum number of samples of 5. The calculation of entropy and purity in the DB- Scan algorithm is performed with either the confusion matrix or a pivot table. The predicted labels are represented by the rows, while the ground truth values are represented by the columns. The sum of squared error (SSE) is determined by first determining the mean or centroid point for each cluster, and next computing the total of the squared differences between each data point and its own cluster mean or centroid.
